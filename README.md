## instructions

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

A static version of the Landing Page was shown by the starting project's HTML and CSS style. By making changes that I made, this project went from being static to being interactive. To do this, several changes to the HTML and CSS styling and the creation of a substantial JS file were made in order to make the project interactive.

# Usage

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

By unzipping the file and using any Code Text Editor (VS Code), you may now utilize the project files.
